# Overview

CineMagic is a comprehensive web application developed for managing cinema operations, from ticket sales to session management, designed for the CineMagic cinema company. Utilizing Laravel, a robust PHP framework, the application provides functionalities across multiple domains including user authentication, movie session scheduling, ticket purchasing, and access control.

# Features

## User Authentication and Management: 
Supports login with email and password, password recovery, and user profile management. Different user roles (customer, staff, admin) have distinct permissions and access levels within the system.

Allows all users, including unauthenticated ones, to view currently showing films, their details, and sessions available.

Successful purchases generate receipts and tickets, which are sent to the user's email. Users can access their purchase history and tickets via unique URLs.
## Session Access Control: 
Staff can verify ticket validity at cinema entry points and manage session access based on ticket statuses.
## Business Administration: 
Admins can manage movies, sessions, rooms, and business parameters like ticket prices and VAT rates. Statistical data on sales and occupancy rates can be visualized and exported.
